# Minimax-PY

A Pythonic implementation of the minimax algorithm in tic tac toe. Similar to my other project, minimax-c, except written solely in Python.

The advantage to using Python is taking console input is easy -- the game is playable in a console window when run.

As always, public license, do whatever you like with it.
